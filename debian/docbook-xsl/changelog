    For more read /usr/share/doc/docbook-xsl/changelog.gz.

  [ Daniel Leidert (package) ]
  * debian/copyright: Removed hint about comment in common localization files,
    because upstream fixed the comment(s) in these files, so misinterpretation
    as an unchangeable file should be impossible.
  * debian/docbook-xsl.dirs: Removed obsolete directory.
  * debian/docbook-xsl.docs:
    debian/docbook-xsl.links:
    debian/README.Debian: Re-added some upstream docs after upstream updated
    and cleaned them (thanks to Michael(tm) Smith). The content of these files
    has been removed from README.Debian.
  * debian/docbook-xsl.examples: Added one more Makefile.
  * debian/docbook-xsl.install: Fixed in respect to wordml -> rountrip
    renaming.
  * debian/control:
    debian/rules: Split docbook-xsl-doc package into a HTML (-html), a PDF
    (-pdf) and a pure ASCII text (-text) documentation package (the two latter
    were added initially).
  * debian/docbook-xsl-doc.doc-base:
    debian/docbook-xsl-doc.docs:
    debian/docbook-xsl-doc.links: Removed for above reason.
  * debian/docbook-xsl-doc-html.copyright:
    debian/docbook-xsl-doc-html.doc-base:
    debian/docbook-xsl-doc-html.docs:

    debian/docbook-xsl-doc-text.copyright:
    debian/docbook-xsl-doc-text.doc-base:
    debian/docbook-xsl-doc-text.docs: Added for above reason.
  * debian/docbook-xsl.preinst:
    debian/docbook-xsl.postinst:
    debian/docbook-xsl.prerm:
    debian/docbook-xsl.links: Changed the creation of the compatibility
    symlink. It is not longer created by the postinst script. Instead a newly
    introduced preinst script removes the existing directory. That makes it
    possible to install a symlink with the package (content) and this symlink
    is removed automatically during package removal/purge, so the prerm script
    becomes obsolete. So it was removed. This IMO enhances the solution for
    bug #393726.
  * debian/rules: Cleaned up the file a bit (upstream removed empty files and
    fixed file permissions).

      manpage output, missing at least one space between the CDATA and the
      elements content (closes: #345750).

  [ Daniel Leidert ]
  * debian/changelog: Added the missing '#' sign to bug-numbers in the
    changelog entry of 1.70.1.dfsg.1-0.1, so the link to the report can be
    automatically created.
  * debian/compat: Raised debhelper compatibility level to 5.
  * debian/control: Fixed Maintainer and Uploaders fields (see
    http://lists.alioth.debian.org/pipermail/debian-xml-sgml-devel/2006-August/000687.html).
    Adjusted debhelper build-dependency version. Extended package description
    for docbook-xsl (also informing about the formats "addeid recently").
  * debian/copyright: Removed the paragraph about the l10n files in common/
    (upstream changed this paragraph accordingly). Added copyright, license
    and warranty information for the files in highlighting.
  * debian/docbook-xsl.examples: Install the manpage example
    debian/examples/foo.1.example_manpage.xml too.
  * debian/docbook-xsl.install: Also install highlighting/*.
  * debian/docbook-xsl.links: Added links for README in
    /usr/share/xml/*/nwalsh/* to /usr/share/doc/docbook-xsl.
  * debian/docbook-xsl.prerm: Removed (empty file).
  * debian/docbook-xsl-doc.doc-base: Also added reference in text and pdf
    format.
  * debian/rules: Also avoid installation of the outdated testtemplate.xml.
    For the moment also avoid an installation of the reference in pdf and text
    format (would increase the size of docbook-xsl-doc to the 4x of the
    current size).
  * debian/README.Debian: Updated some outdated information I missed
    earlier. Added references to README.*, where available.
  * debian/examples/foo.1.example_manpage.xml: Added. This file is a sample
    manpage written in XML to help manpage writers with an example that shows
    the full power of the current docbook-xsl package (it was added in
    relation to bug #383495).
  * Adjusted patches:
    - debian/patches/01_create_debian_catalog.dpatch: Adjusted.
  * Removed patches:
    - debian/patches/10_html_use_copy_of_parameter_value.dpatch: Removed.
      Fixed in upstream.
    - debian/patches/11_html_make_x_html_output_valid.dpatch: Ditto.
    - debian/patches/12_html_add_sectioninfo_keywordsets_meta.dpatch: Ditto.
    - debian/patches/13_man_process_every_copyright_element.dpatch: Ditto.
    - debian/patches/90_common_l10n_updates.dpatch: Ditto.
  * Added patches:
    - debian/patches/10_manpages_fix_bold_author_markup.dpatch: Added.
      - manpages/info.xsl: Fixes the missing formatting in AUTHORS, that was
        lost with the normalization fix.
    - debian/patches/90_fix_readme_contents.dpatch: Added.
      - template/README: Added the installation directoy to avoid confusion
        when a user reads the link /usr/share/doc/docbook-xsl/README.template.
      - wordml/README: Similar.
  * debian/patches/00list: Adjusted accordingly.

docbook-xsl (1.70.1.dfsg.1-0.1) unstable; urgency=high

  * NMU
  * New upstream release 1.70.1 (closes: #322686, #367694).
  * This release contains many fixes. Several bugs reported to the BTS are not
    longer reproducible:
    - The <webtoc> tag now produces a TOC when XSL(T) conversion is done on
      the provided example website.xml (closes: #172996).
    - Hyphenation of URLs in manpages is now suppressed by default - see also
      the man.hyphenate.urls parameter reference (closes: #175681).
    - The <arg> element is formatted bold by default in manpages
      (closes: #175734).
    - Using the <refsynopsisdiv> element no longer misses a "SYNOPSIS" section
      in FO output (closes: #184673).
    - Generated XHTML contains a DOCTYPE (closes: #186836).
    - Improved troff translation of the <literallayout> element
      (closes: #199517).
    - A work-around for the broken passivetex list-item-body rendering was
      added by upstream to FO stylesheets (closes: #225192, #232192).
    - The <email> element is not longer ignored when used as children of the
      <author>, <editor> or <othercredit> elements (closes: #236960).
    - Mapping of unicode symbols and special characters is now handled
      corresponding to groff escape sequences using the "character map" format
      described in the XSLT 2.0 specification (closes: #238517, #334874).
    - The handling of <segmentedlist> elements has been improved in many ways,
      including indentation and styling-options (closes: #270155).
    - Linking the next chunk in bibliographies no longer fails
      (closes: #276136).
    - Information given during manpage generation can be suppressed now, so
      that the process runs quietly - see also the man.output.quietly and the
      refentry.meta.get.quietly parameter reference (closes: #304011).
    - Nesting italic and bold formatted elements in manpages no longer
      produces a wrongly formatted/broken output (closes: #330129).

  [ Daniel Leidert ]
  * debian/control:
    - Changed to standards version 3.7.2 (fixed build-dependecies to fit
      section 7.6).
    - Split the package into a package containing the stylesheets
      (docbook-xsl) and the documentation (docbook-xsl-doc).
    - Fixed recommended packages for docbook-xsl-doc (closes: #276471).
    - Fixed 'Homepage' URL (closes: #310245, #360029).
    - Fixed a typo.
  * debian/copyright:
    - Adjusted and completed copyright and license information.
    - Added a text copy of the Mozilla Public License (MPL) version 1.1.
  * debian/rules:
    - Added dpatch stuff.
    - Removed all empty files (param.html, pi.html) to fix a Lintian/linda
      warning.
    - Removed all outdated ChangeLog* files and the *.xweb and param.{ent,xml}
      files, we don't need.
  * debian/catalog.xml, docbook-xsl.xmlcatalogs,
    debian/patches/01_create_debian_catalog.dpatch:
    - Upstream now ships a catalog, so debian/catalog.xml can be removed and
      catalog.xml patched instead.
  * debian/docbook-xsl.docs, debian/docbook-xsl-doc.docs,
    debian/docbook-xsl.doc-base, debian/docbook-xsl-doc.doc-base,
    debian/README.Debian:
    - Package was split, so documentation and doc-base control file go to
      docbook-xsl-doc package.
    - Updated README.Debian and added the bits of information TODO, BUGS etc.
      contain (it's not that much, that shipping these file is necessary).
  * debian/docbook-xsl.install:
    - Added slides/, website/ and wordml/ directories.
  * debian/docbook-xsl.examples:
    - Added the Makefiles.
  * debian/patches/10_html_use_copy_of_parameter_value.dpatch: Added.
    - html/biblio.xsl: Added patch to use xsl:copy-of for
      biblioentry.item.separator.
    - xhtml/biblio.xsl: Ditto.
  * debian/patches/11_html_make_x_html_output_valid.dpatch: Added.
    - html/biblio.xsl: Fixed an issue when processing a bibliolist element,
      that leads to invalid HTML output.
    - xhtml/biblio.xsl: Ditto.
    - html/qandaset.xsl: Fixed an issue when processing the answer element,
      containing one or more qandaentry elements. This issue also leads to
      invalid HTML output.
    - xhtml/qandaset.xsl: Ditto.
  * debian/patches/12_html_add_sectioninfo_keywordsets_meta.dpatch: Added.
    - html/docbook.xsl: Fixed a missing processing instruction for keywordsets
      inside sectioninfo elements. This issue leads to an incomplete keyword
      META tag.
    - xhtml/docbook.xsl: Ditto.
  * debian/patches/13_man_process_every_copyright_element.dpatch: Added.
    - manpages/info.xsl: Process every copyright and legalnotice element, not
      just the first one, so the legal information is correct.
  * debian/patches/90_common_l10n_updates.dpatch: Added.
    - common/fr.xml: Updates from SVN.
    - common/pl.xml: Ditto.
