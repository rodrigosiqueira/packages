docbook-xsl (1.74.3+dfsg-1) unstable; urgency=low

  IMPORTANT: The stylesheets have been moved from
  /usr/share/xml/docbook/stylesheet/nwalsh/ to
  /usr/share/xml/docbook/stylesheet/docbook-xsl/. The old directory is a
  symlink to the new location for compatibility reasons. Note, that I plan to
  drop the old location /usr/share/xml/docbook/stylesheet/nwalsh/ in the
  future. So plese adjust the path in your scripts, XML documents, ... or
  better: use the WWW resource URI and the catalog system.

  The patch to support reading the default papersize from /etc/papersize
  (#173093, #382505) has been dropped, because it creates a failure if the
  configuration file is not present (#511005). So use a frontend, which
  supports libpaper or set the paper.type parameter in your stylesheet.

  There is now also a new script `dbtoepub' (PoC, alpha state) to create EPUB
  output from DocBook books and articles. Send your suggestions.

docbook-xsl (1.73.2.dfsg.1-2) unstable; urgency=low

  This release fixes the broken legalnotice and revhistory links in (X)HTML
  output. It further implements a design change made by upstream - you now
  MUST set the use.id.as.filename to create legalnotice or revhistory
  filenames from their ID. Otherwise the stylesheets will fall back to use
  generate-id() and compute a filename from the return value of this XSLT
  function. In the past, existing IDs were used, even if use.id.as.filename
  was not set. Alternatively you can also use the dbhtml filename PI to choose
  a name for your revhistory or legalnotice chunk(s).

docbook-xsl (1.73.0.dfsg.1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  In the 1.72.0 release there was a regression regarding the backslash,
    dot and dash handling, that lead to several "broken" manpages, showing
    visible man macros. These issues wer almost caused by some non-compliant
    custom templates. In the following bug reports

    <URL:http://bugs.debian.org/415488> (docbook-xsl)
    <URL:http://bugs.debian.org/415468> (aptitude)
    <URL:http://bugs.debian.org/420114> (git-core)

    you can read more about the details and probelms. With the 1.73 release,
    upstream reverted this change and restored the pre-1.72 behaviour.
    However, whenever you need to make some text bold or italic in manpages,
    read the comments in
    /usr/share/xml/docbook/stylesheet/nwalsh/manpages/utility.xsl about the
    available bold/italic named templates or ask for assistence to avoid the
    same issues in the future.

  Footnote handling in the current manpages code pretty much assumes that,
    if you have a table or list or something in footnote, it's always
    preceded by some text -- like, <foonote><para>The following list shows foo
    bar...<itemizedlist> ... </footnote> instead of
    <footnote><itemizedlist>...</footnote> or <footnote><table>...</footnote>.
    See the release notes in /usr/share/doc/docbook-xsl/changelog.gz for a
    more detailed explanation and other important hints.

  Further a special (Debian-only) patch has been implemented to fix the bugs

    <URL:http://bugs.debian.org/173093>
    <URL:http://bugs.debian.org/382505>

    In these reports it was requested, that the default value of the
    paper.type parameter is set accordingly to the value in /etc/papersize.
    This patch is considered to be experimental. Don't bug upstream with
    issues, if you observe one - only bug me (and the Debian BTS). A further
    limitation is, that only the values, that are shared between the
    paper.type parameter values of docbook-xsl and the papersize values are
    currently supported. Otherwise, the code will fall back to the default
    'USletter'.

docbook-xsl (1.72.0.dfsg.1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  The docbook-xsl-doc package was split into 3 packages:

    - docbook-xsl-doc-html - containing the HTML documentation (shipped with
                             docbook-xsl-doc in the past)
    - docbook-xsl-doc-pdf  - containing a PDF version of the documentation
    - docbook-xsl-doc-text - containing a plain ASCII text version of the
                             documentation

  All 3 packages conflict with docbook-xsl-doc to ease transition.
