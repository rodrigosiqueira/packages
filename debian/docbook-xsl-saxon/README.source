docbook-xsl-saxon for Debian
----------------------------

To avoid problems with binaries and binary changes in the Debian package (e.g.
with dpkg-source), the binaries are removed from the distributed tarball and
the archive is repackaged for Debian. This also reduces the size of the source
to 1/4 of the original size.
