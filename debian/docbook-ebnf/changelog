docbook-ebnf (1.2~cr1-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * New maintainer (closes: #295580).
  * This is not really a new upstream version, just an update of the packaging
    files along with a bug-fix. It further lets me create a new .orig.tar.gz
    tarbll based on the new rules in the get-orig-source target, so the
    tarball creation is more transparent.

  [ Daniel Leidert ]
  * debian/compat: Increased debhelper compatibility level to v4.
  * debian/contrib/catalog.*: Added. They are templates to create the real
    SGML and XML catalogs via debian/rules.
  * debian/control: Added XS-Vcs-Browser and XS-Vcs-Svn fields.
    (Maintainer): I'm the new maintainer.
    (Uploaders): Added the Debian XML/SGML group.
    (Build-Depends-Indep): Moved debhelper to Build-Depends and adjusted
    version dependency (see debian/compat).
    (Standards-Version): Bump to latest standards version.
    (Description): Fixed package reference and added Homepage field.
  * debian/copyright: Updated. Added copyright information found in DTDs.
  * debian/docbook-ebnf.dirs: Added. Removed the related part in debian/rules.
  * debian/docbook-ebnf.links: Ditto.
  * debian/docbook-ebnf.sgmlcatalogs: Removed. It's created by debian/rules
    automatically.
  * debian/docbook-ebnf.xmlcatalogs: Ditto. But the created file does not
    longer miss to register the entries in the root catalog (closes: #299692).
  * debian/rules: Cleaned the file a lot. Moved stuff to be done via debhelper
    scripts out of debian/rules into debhelper template files. Added rules to
    automatically walk through the source(s) and create catalogs and related
    debhelper templates. Added get-orig-source target to document the way, the
    upstream tarball is created.
  * debian/watch: Removed (useless, because it doesn't work).

docbook-ebnf (1.0+really1.2cr1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release candidate.
  * Fixed debian/watch to catch pre-releases.  Still misses that 1.2CR1 >>
    1.2b1 but well, that's life.

 -- Yann Dirson <dirson@debian.org>  Fri, 24 Sep 2004 23:53:51 +0200

docbook-ebnf (1.0+really1.2b1-4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Workaround the lack of good solution to migrate a directory to a
    compat symlink, by removing the /usr/share/sgml/docbook/custom/ebnf
    directory in preinst (Closes: #255770).

 -- Yann Dirson <dirson@debian.org>  Sat,  7 Aug 2004 00:27:18 +0200

docbook-ebnf (1.0+really1.2b1-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Suggest docbook-defguide instead of obsoloete docbook-book (Closes: #255679).

 -- Yann Dirson <dirson@debian.org>  Tue, 22 Jun 2004 14:33:03 +0200

docbook-ebnf (1.0+really1.2b1-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added missing build-dep on xml-core (Closes: #255604).

docbook-ebnf (1.0+really1.2b1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream pre-release, for use with docbook 4.3.
  * Depend on docbook-xml 4.3 so that the latest DTD is guaranted to work.
  * Install into /usr/share/xml/ instead of /usr/share/sgml/, with a
    compat symlink.  
  * Renamed sgml catalog to "catalog".
  * Declare the xml catalog using dh_installxmlcatalogs - hopefully I will
    have done things OK with this.  Added ${misc:Depends} to Depends.

 -- Yann Dirson <dirson@debian.org>  Sun, 20 Jun 2004 22:47:28 +0200

docbook-ebnf (1.0+really1.1cr1-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Use relative paths in SGML catalog.
  * Switch to dh_installcatalogs.
  * Provide an XML catalog (Closes: #176970), but don't declare it since
    there does not seem to be a standard way for this, and the
    update-xmlcatalog is not clear, and even docbook-xml does not declare
    its own ones.
  * Switch to debian/compat.

 -- Yann Dirson <dirson@debian.org>  Wed, 29 Oct 2003 23:19:05 +0100
